A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson (\bosH) produced in association with a weak vector boson (\VH) and decaying into a bottom-antibottom quark pair (\bb) is reported for the decay channels \ZnnHbb, \WenHbb, \WmnHbb, \ZeeHbb, and \ZmmHbb, with a focus on \ZnnHbb\ in particular. The search is performed with a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.3 \invfb\ at a center-of-mass energy of \sqrts\ = 13 \TeV\ recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC during Run 2 in 2017. An excess of events is observed above the expected background with a significance of 3.3 standard deviations, which is compatible with the Standard Model expectation of 3.1 standard deviations for a Higgs boson of mass \massH\ = 125.09 \GeV. When combined with the results of previous \VH\ measurements and \Htobb\ searches using other Higgs production modes, the observed (expected) significance is 5.6 (5.5) standard deviations. This represents the first observation of \Htobb\ by the CMS experiment.
