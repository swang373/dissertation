\chapter{INTRODUCTION} \label{intro}

The fundamental structure of the universe has remained an enduring fascination of mankind. The philosophers of antiquity speculated that the world could be decomposed into the base elements of water, earth, fire, and air. The alchemists of the Middle Ages, regarding the classical elements to be expressions of hidden substance, sought to unveil its nature with crude experiments. The scholars of the Renaissance rejected the Aristotelian description of physical phenomena for its empirical failures and pondered if atoms were the indivisible units of matter. The chemists of the 19th century advanced and refined the atomic theory in their pursuit to catalog the pure elements. The physicists of the 20th century realized the necessity of a quantum description of the universe while delving into the subatomic realm. The scientific paradigm of the current era now rests on the theoretical framework known as the Standard Model of particle physics which, though understood to be incomplete, has had its predictions verified with remarkable accuracy.

\section{The Standard Model}

The fundamental forces\footnote{Gravity, which does not have a satisfactory quantum description, falls outside of the Standard Model.} and forms of matter within the universe are explained by the Standard Model in terms of elementary particles, their antiparticles, and their interactions. The following subsections highlight the features of the model necessary to motivate the treatise of this paper. A formal and rigorous treatment of the theory is beyond the scope of this paper but may be found in such texts as Ref. \cite{Peskin} and \cite{Schwartz}.

The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) in which fundamental particles are understood to be excitations of their associated fields that permeate all of space-time. The fundamental forces are generated by the internal gauge symmetry of the model \symSM, which give rise to the strong (\symSTRONG), weak (\symWEAK), and electromagnetic (\symEM) interactions. Its current formulation is thus a combination of electroweak theory with quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The particles manifested by the model may be broadly categorized into \textit{fermions} and \textit{bosons} and a visual summary is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SM}.

    \label{fig:SM}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fermions}

The fermions encompass all forms of ordinary and exotic matter and obey Fermi-Dirac statistics because of their half-integer spin, namely, spin-\ensuremath{\frac{1}{2}}. They are divided into \textit{leptons} and \textit{quarks}. The electrically charged leptons interact via the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces and include the familiar \textit{electron} (\lepe), the \textit{muon} (\lepm), and the \textit{tau} (\lept). The charged leptons also have neutral counterparts (\lepne, \lepnm, \lepnt) known as \textit{neutrinos}, which interact solely via the weak nuclear force. The quarks, having both electric and color charge, interact via the electromagnetic and strong and weak nuclear forces and include the up (\qrku), down (\qrkd), charm (\qrkc), strange (\qrks), bottom (\qrkb), and top (\qrkt). Although the leptons can exist freely, the nature of the strong interaction gives rise to color confinement, whereby quarks only appear within composite particles called hadrons. The bound states of quark doublets are known as mesons while those of quark triplets, of which the familiar proton is an example, are known as baryons.

The leptons and quarks are each arranged into pairs by flavour quantum number and sorted into three generations of increasing mass\footnote{The observation of neutrino oscillations disproved the prediction that they are massless but its implications for the lepton generations are unclear.}, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:SM}. The more massive particles of the higher generations decay into the stable particles of the first generation, which corroborates the observation that ordinary matter consists of electrons and up and down quarks which are bound in protons and neutrons. There are no known constraints on the number of fermion generations, although experimental results suggest there are only three.

\subsection{Bosons}

The bosons, which obey Bose-Einstein statistics because of their integer spin, are divided into vector and scalar bosons. The spin-1 vector, or gauge, bosons mediate the fundamental forces and are exchanged between elementary particles during their interactions. The photon (\bosg) mediates the electromagnetic force, which is responsible for the phenomenon of intermolecular repulsion.\footnote{It is this repulsion that prevents us from passing through objects.} The \bosW\ and \bosZ\ bosons mediate the weak nuclear force that causes nuclear decay. And finally, the gluons (\bosgln) mediate the strong nuclear force that binds quarks into hadrons and even protons and neutrons in nuclei. The only spin-0 scalar boson in the theory is the Higgs boson (\bosH), which is responsible for the masses of the heavy gauge bosons and fermions.

\subsection{The Higgs Mechanism}

The requirement of gauge invariance under \symWEAK\ leads to a prediction of massless gauge bosons, which stands in contrast to the observation that the weak vector bosons are massive. In order to reconcile this observation while preserving the gauge invariance of the interaction, a mechanism of \textit{spontaneous symmetry breaking} was incorporated into the unified electroweak theory proposed by Sheldon Glashow \cite{EWKGLASHOW}, Abdus Salam \cite{EWKSALAM}, and Steven Weinberg \cite{EWKWEINBERG}. This mechanism, which came to be known as the \textit{Higgs mechanism}, was independently developed by Robert Brout and Fran\c{c}ois Englert \cite{HIGGSBE}, its namesake Peter Higgs \cite{HIGGSH}, and Gerald Guralnik, Richard Hagen, and Sir Thomas Kibble \cite{HIGGSGHK}.

The mechanism introduces into the Standard Model a scalar field $\phi$ represented as a complex doublet
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \begin{pmatrix}
           \phi^{+} \\
           \phi^{0} \\
         \end{pmatrix}
       = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
         \begin{pmatrix}
           \phi_{1} + i\phi_{2} \\
           \phi_{3} + i\phi_{4} \\
         \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
and its potential $V(\phi)$ of the form
\begin{equation}
V(\phi) = \mu^{2}\phi^{\dag}\phi + \frac{\lambda}{2}(\phi^{\dag}\phi)^{2},
\end{equation}
where the real parameters $\mu^{2}$ and $\lambda$ represent the mass and self-coupling, respectively. The self-coupling $\lambda$ is taken to be positive by convention such that the potential is bounded from below. When $\mu^{2} > 0$, the potential is parabolic in shape and the ground state of the vacuum is at $\phi = 0$, keeping its symmetries intact. However, when $\mu^{2} < 0$, the minimum of the potential is no longer at $\phi = 0$ but rather\footnote{The solution is unique up to a phase $e^{i\theta}$, but it is customary to take $\theta = 0$.}
\begin{equation}
  v = \left(\frac{-\mu^{2}}{\lambda}\right)^{1/2},
  \label{eq:vev}
\end{equation}
where the vacuum now attains an expectation value $v$ in its ground state. The shape of such a potential is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:potential}. The Higgs mechanism thus provides the means to spontaneously break the $\symWEAK \times \symEM$ symmetry within the model.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/higgspotential}
    \caption[Shape of the Higgs Field Potential]{The shape of the Higgs field potential for $\mu^{2} < 0$ \cite{deBoer:2013pud}. The transition of the field from its unstable state at the origin to its true ground state spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry of the system.}
    \label{fig:potential}
\end{figure}

Because particles are excitations of their fields, the presence of the Higgs field also suggests the existence of the Higgs boson. An expression for the mass of this new boson can be determined by expanding the potential around the vacuum ground state $\phi_{0}$. By choosing the unitary gauge, the components of $\phi_{0}$ become
\begin{equation}
  (\phi_{1})_{0} = 0, (\phi_{2})_{0} = 0, (\phi_{3})_{0} = v, (\phi_{4})_{0} = 0
\end{equation}
and $\phi_{0}$ becomes simply
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{0} = \begin{pmatrix}
               \phi^{+} \\
               \phi^{0} \\
             \end{pmatrix}_{0}
           = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
             \begin{pmatrix}
               0 \\
               v \\
             \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Then for small fluctuations $\phi(x) = \phi_{0} + H(x)$, the potential to second order in $H$ becomes
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    V(\phi) &= \frac{\mu^{2}}{2}(v^{2} + 2vH + H^{2}) + \frac{\lambda}{4}(v^{2} + 2vH + H^{2})^{2} \\
            &= \frac{1}{2}(\mu^{2}v^{2} + \frac{\lambda}{2}v^{4}) + (\mu^{2}v + \lambda v^{3})H + \frac{1}{2}(\mu^{2} + 3\lambda v^{2})H^{2} + \mathcal{O}(H^{3}) \\
            &= V_{0} - \frac{1}{2}(2\mu^{2})H^{2} + \mathcal{O}(H^{3}), \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
where $V_{0}$ collects the constant terms and Eq. \ref{eq:vev} has been used to vanish the first order term and simplify the second order term. The mass can be read from the coefficient of the second order term in $H$:
\begin{equation}
  m_{H}^{2} = -2\mu^{2} \implies m_{H} = \sqrt{2}\mu.
\end{equation}
Because $\mu^2$ was chosen to be negative, the sign of the mass is correct. Although the Standard Model predicts a massive Higgs boson, its dependence on the unknown parameter $\mu$ means it must be determined experimentally.

\subsubsection{Gauge boson masses}

The necessity of the Higgs mechanism is realized by its generation of the gauge boson masses. The Lagrangian for the Higgs may be written as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\phi} = (D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dag}(D^{\mu}\phi) - V(\phi) = (D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dag}(D^{\mu}\phi) - \mu^{2}\phi^{\dag}\phi - \frac{\lambda}{2}(\phi^{\dag}\phi)^{2},
  \label{eq:Lhiggs}
\end{equation}
By definition, the Higgs field has weak hypercharge $Y = +1$ and weak isospin $T_{3} = -1/2$. The weak hypercharge $Y$ and weak isospin $T$ are the generators of the \symWEAK\ and \symEM\ symmetries, respectively, with the choice of their values made to satisfy the relation
\begin{equation}
  Q = T_{3} + \frac{1}{2}Y,
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the electric charge.\footnote{Hence, the Higgs boson is a neutral particle.} These choices require the covariant derivative of the kinetic term to be of the form
\begin{equation}
  D_{\mu}\phi = (\partial_{\mu} - \frac{i}{2}g\boldsymbol\sigma\cdot\mathbf{W}_{\mu} - \frac{i}{2}g^{\prime}B_{\mu})\phi,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{W_{\mu}}$ and $B_{\mu}$ are, respectively, the \symWEAK\ and \symEM\ gauge bosons, $g$ and $g^{\prime}$ are the corresponding gauge couplings, and $\boldsymbol\sigma = \sigma^{a}, a = 1, 2, 3$ are the Pauli matrices.

The gauge boson masses are contained in the kinetic term of the Lagrangian and can be determined by evaluating near the vacuum ground state. The covariant derivative becomes
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    D_{\mu}\phi &\rightarrow \left[ \partial_{\mu} - \frac{i}{2}g \begin{pmatrix} W_{\mu}^{3} & W_{\mu}^{1} - iW_{\mu}^{2} \\ W_{\mu}^{1} + iW_{\mu}^{2} & -W_{\mu}^{3} \\ \end{pmatrix} - \frac{i}{2}g^{\prime}B_{\mu} \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v + H \\ \end{pmatrix} \\[1em]
                &= -\frac{i}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}(W_{\mu}^{1}-iW_{\mu}^{2})(v + H) \\ i\sqrt{2}\partial_{\mu}H + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-gW_{\mu}^{3} + g^{\prime}B_{\mu})(v + H) \\ \end{pmatrix} \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
and substituting this expression into Eq. \ref{eq:Lhiggs} while ignoring the potential term for clarity yields
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \mathcal{L}_{\phi} &= \frac{1}{4} \begin{vmatrix} \frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}(W_{\mu}^{1}-iW_{\mu}^{2})(v + H) \\ i\sqrt{2}\partial_{\mu}H + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-gW_{\mu}^{3} + g^{\prime}B_{\mu})(v + H) \\ \end{vmatrix}^{2} \\[1em]
                       &= \frac{1}{4} \left[ 2(\partial_{\mu}H)^{2} + \left( \frac{g^{2}}{2} \left( (W_{\mu}^{1})^{2} + (W_{\mu}^{2})^{2} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( g^{\prime}B_{\mu} - gW_{\mu}^{3} \right)^{2} \right) (v + H)^{2} \right] \\[1em]
                       &= \frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}H)^{2} + \frac{g^{2}}{8}(W_{\mu}^{1})^{2}v^{2} + \frac{g^{2}}{8}(W_{\mu}^{2})^{2}v^{2} + \frac{1}{8}\left( g^{\prime}B_{\mu} - gW_{\mu}^{3} \right)^{2}v^{2} + \mathcal{O}(H), \\
    \label{eq:gaugemasses}
  \end{split}
\end{align}
where higher order terms in $H$ have been discarded. The result of Eq. \ref{eq:gaugemasses} reveals that the broken symmetry of the Higgs field causes the $W_{\mu}^{1}$ and $W_{\mu}^{2}$ vector fields to both acquire a mass of
\begin{equation}
  m_{W}^{2} = \frac{g^{2}v^{2}}{4} \implies m_{W} = \frac{gv}{2}.
\end{equation}
The linear combination of vector fields $(g^{\prime}B_{\mu} - gW_{\mu}^{3})$ also acquires a mass that depends on the couplings $g$ and $g^{\prime}$, and is typically expressed as
\begin{equation}
  m_{Z}^{2} = \frac{(g^{2} + g^{\prime 2}) v^{2}}{4} \implies m_{Z} = \frac{\sqrt{g^{2} + g^{\prime 2}} v}{2}.
\end{equation}
The excitations of these massive vector fields are the weak gauge bosons \bosWp, \bosWm, and \bosZn which have been observed in nature and whose masses have been measured\cite{PDG2018} to be
\begin{equation}
  m_{\bosWp} = m_{\bosWm} = 80.379 \pm 0.012\ \GeV\ \mathrm{and}\ m_{\bosZn} = 91.1876 \pm 0.0021\ \GeV.
\end{equation}

The derivation would be complete but for a missing gauge boson. Recall our earlier transformation to the unitary gauge which fixed three of the four degrees of freedom of the Higgs field. According to Goldstone's Theorem \cite{Goldstone}, these degrees of freedom become the longitudinal polarizations of the now massive weak gauge bosons. The remaining degree of freedom corresponds to the massless photon \bosg, the gauge boson of the electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field $A_{\mu}$ appears as the linear combination $(g^{\prime}W_{\mu}^{3} + gB_{\mu})$ which is orthogonal to the field of \bosZn.

%\section{Image Handling in XeLaTeX}

%One of the biggest reasons for switching from the dvipdfm/dvipdfmx methods of compiling is the improved image handling capabilities. EPS, Bit-mapped, PDF, JPG, and PNG formats work well with the xelatex process.
%
%\subsection{The Traditional EPS Format}
%
%EPS format is the traditional format for LaTeX, but EPS files can be very large and many programs can't create or view these images. There are many programs that are used to interpret data and output the results as an EPS format image. It has been my experience that there are bounding box problems with these figures. On many occasions we have opened the image in Adobe Photoshop and, without making any changes, saved the document as a Photoshop EPS file, re-compiled the document, and the image worked correctly, so if you are having problems with an EPS image not showing in your document correctly, try this fix first.
