\chapter{EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS} \label{experiment}

It is nature's irony, that the study of subatomic particles requires the largest and most intricate machines known to date in human history. Because the physics of such particles are described by their interactions, high energy physics experiments typically accelerate particles to extreme kinetic energies, collide them against each other or dense targets, and infer the details of their interaction from the resulting final state particles. Such collisions can be \textit{elastic}, where the interacting particles merely exchange energy and remain unchanged, or \textit{inelastic}, where the interaction changes the incoming particles and has a chance of creating new, massive particles because of the time-energy uncertainty relation. Collisions of the latter kind are thus of great interest to experimentalists in the search for new particles and their decays.

Under the consideration of providing as much energy as possible towards the interaction, modern experiments favor colliding beams over fixed-target experiments. By momentum conservation, some of the energy of a fixed-target collision must be converted into the kinetic energies of final state particles, while there is no such constraint for colliding beams. Thus, at high energies, the dependence of the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ on the incoming beam energy $E_{\textrm{beam}}$ in the laboratory frame scales as $\sqrt{s} \propto E_{\textrm{beam}}^{1/2}$ for fixed-targets, whereas it scales linearly for colliding beams $\sqrt{s} \propto E_{\textrm{beam}}$. Because the center-of-mass energy of the collision fixes the energy available for the production of new particles, colliding beams hold the advantage.

Modern experiments also favor circular rather than linear particle accelerators. Because the length of a linear accelerator is correlated with its maximum beam energy, the size required to probe the current energy frontier is prohibitively large, and even then particles can only be accelerated once through the machine. Instead, circular colliders can accelerate particles for multiple orbits until they reach the desired energy scale, and this circulation also allows for the same beams to be collided multiple times to achieve a \textit{luminosity}, a measure of particle flux, that is higher than linear accelerators. The problem faced by circular colliders is synchrotron radiation, where charged particles accelerated along a circular trajectory lose energy. Because a particle's energy loss due to synchrotron radiation is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its particle's mass, electron beams experience incredible energy losses compared to proton beams. For this reason, modern experiments prefer the acceleration and collision of hadron beams.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the culmination of contemporary high energy experiment sensibilities. The world's largest machine, it is a circular accelerator with a circumference of 27 km, spanning across the Franco-Swiss border, and is housed within an underground tunnel at an average depth of 100 m. An illustration is provided in Figure \ref{fig:LHCoverallview}. It features two parallel evacuated beam pipes in which proton beams circulate in opposite directions. Although the design energy of each proton beam is 7 \TeV, the beams are currently circulating at an energy of 6.5 \TeV\ to give a center-of-mass energy of 13 \TeV\ for the one billion proton collisions it produces per second.

    \label{fig:LHCoverallview}
\end{figure}

Because the LHC reuses the tunnels of the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) Collider, additional excavation was avoided and it was integrated as the final stage of CERN's accelerator complex, shown in Figure \ref{fig:CERNcomplex}. The source of protons is a canister of hydrogen gas to which a strong electric field is applied to strip the electrons from the hydrogen nuclei. The protons then pass through the linear accelerator LINAC2 and are accelerated to an energy of 50 \MeV. They are then injected into successive circular accelerators: the Proton Synchrotron Booster which accelerates the beams to 1.4 \GeV, the Proton Synchrotron (PS) which accelerates the beams to 25 GeV, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) which further accelerates the beams to 450 \GeV, and finally the LHC itself. The oscillating radio frequency (RF) fields used to accelerate the protons results in beams composed of proton \textit{bunches} as opposed to a continuous stream. The LHC currently circulates up to 2556 bunches per beam, which is not far from its design value of 2808 bunches per beam.

\end{figure}

The circular orbit of the proton beams are maintained by the 1,232 bending magnets lining the LHC. The bending magnets are superconducting dipole magnets which generate 8.3 T magnetic fields powerful enough to bend the high energy beams. In order to minimize the oscillation of the bunches around their trajectories and achieve high luminosity, 392 focusing magnets are also placed along the LHC ring. The focusing magnets are superconducting quadrupole magnets with a magnetic field gradient of 223 T/m. They are placed in alternating pairs to account for their nature of focusing along one direction while defocusing the orthogonal direction. Schematics for these two main types of magnets are shown in Figure \ref{fig:lhcmagnets}

  \label{fig:lhcmagnets}
\end{figure}

The beams are directed to cross through each other at four sites around the LHC known as interactions points. At these points, fine control of the beam is crucial because it has direct ramifications on the number of possible interactions. The interaction rate of any given process is proportional to its cross section $\sigma$ and the luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ of the collider
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dN}{dt} = \sigma\mathcal{L},
\end{equation}
where $N$ refers to the number of interactions. The cross section, or interaction probability, is fixed by physics while the luminosity is determined by the collider's design, and therefore the highest possible luminosity is desired in order to observe rare interactions such as those that produce Higgs bosons. For equal, bunched beams with a rounded profile, the luminosity can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{ N^{2} k_{b} f \gamma }{ 4 \pi \epsilon_{n} \beta^{\ast} } F,
\end{equation}
where the various parameters are determined by the design of the collider:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $N$ is the number of protons per bunch,
  \item $k_{b}$ is the number of bunches,
  \item $f$ is the revolution frequency,
  \item $\gamma$ is the typical Lorentz factor,
  \item $\epsilon_{n}$ is the normalized emittance,
  \item $\beta^{\ast}$ is the value of the beta function at the interaction point,
  \item $F$ is the geometrical reduction factor due to the crossing angle.\cite{lumiequation}
\end{itemize}

The LHC has a 25 ns bunch spacing, or time between bunch crossings at the interaction point, which places a constraint on how large $k_{b}$ and $f$ can be. The spacing cannot be lowered due to operational safety concerns, such as providing kicker magnets enough time to ramp up and divert the bunches toward a beam dump for absorption. The normalized emittance $\epsilon_{n}$ is a measure of the kinematic phase space occupied by the particles in the bunch and can be improved by reducing the size of the bunch and the spread in momentum of its particles. The beta function is a measure of the beam's transverse size and so its value at the interaction point $\beta^{\ast}$ is determined by how well the magnets can focus the beam at the interaction point. The geometrical factor $F$ corrects the amount by which the colliding bunches overlap as they are made to cross at a shallow angle. While a head-on collision would result in the greatest overlap, it also increases the chances of long range electromagnetic interactions between bunches, so there is some interplay in determining the crossing angle.

Although the design luminosity of the LHC is $10^{34}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, it has exceeded expectations by achieving a luminosity of twice the designed value. As a measure of particle flux, the luminosity that has been discussed so far is a dynamic quantity and is better called \textit{instantaneous luminosity}. The expected number of interactions $N$ for a given process is thus given by
\begin{equation}
  N = \int \sigma\mathcal{L}dt = \sigma \int \mathcal{L}dt = \sigma \mathcal{L}_{int},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ is the \textit{integrated luminosity}, and so the total integrated luminosity is quoted in reference to the size of particle physics datasets.

Surrounding the four interaction points of the LHC are its four main experiments: A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE), A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS), the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), and the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb). Both ATLAS and CMS are general-purpose detectors designed to search for the Higgs boson and perform precise measurements of its properties, while also exploring the new energy frontier in search of physics beyond the Standard Model. The LHC can also accelerate lead ions, which is used by ALICE to study heavy-ion collisions and the dynamics of quark-gluon plasma. As general-purpose detectors, ATLAS and CMS also study heavy-ion collisions. The LHCb experiment specializes in studying the electroweak and QCD physics of heavy flavor quarks and measuring the properties of B mesons.

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid}

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:CMScutaway}, is a general-purpose detector capable of detecting more just than muons. The namesake feature is the superconducting solenoid around which the detector is built. Its cylindrical design is impressively compact, with a diameter of 15 m and a length of 28.7 m, and houses layers of subsystems dedicated towards the detection and measurement of different particles.

%Many of the problems in theses and dissertations involve tables. The UF Graduate Counsel is very specific in the Table Requirements.\renewcommand*{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}\footnote{an un-numbered footnote}\renewcommand*{\thefootnote}{\arabic{footnote}}\setcounter{footnote}{0}There should be no vertical lines in tables and only three horizontal lines. No bold text, etc., see the web site for the complete list of requirements.\footnote{and now we're back to normal footnote marking} One simple improvement can be incorporated by using tabularx instead of the tabular environment. This allows a table to be stretched the full text width easily, which avoids the centered or left aligned issue. \cite{garfinkle1991charged} Table \ref{first} is an examble of the tabularx code.

%\subsection{Long (and/or Wide) Tables}
%
%Another problem in LaTeX is the inability to handle long tables. While there are some packages that address this problem none of them quite fit the Editorial Office guidelines. The caption is not repeated but we do need "Table x-y. Continued" on each subsequent page and a repeat of the column headings on each page as well. The following table is the best example of the correct format I can produce. The disadvantage of this method is that much of it is manually set up and changes in the text will cause changes in the table. \citep{Moffatt69} For best results avoid the use of footnotemark and footnotetext commands inside of tables and try to keep your footnotes outside of floats whenever possible.
