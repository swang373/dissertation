\chapter{EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS} \label{experiment}

It is nature's irony, that the study of subatomic particles requires the largest and most intricate machines known to date in human history. Because the physics of such particles are described by their interactions, high energy physics experiments typically accelerate particles to extreme kinetic energies, collide them against each other or dense targets, and infer the details of their interaction from the resulting final state particles. Such collisions can be \textit{elastic}, where the interacting particles merely exchange energy and remain unchanged, or \textit{inelastic}, where the interaction changes the incoming particles and has a chance of creating new, massive particles because of the time-energy uncertainty relation. Collisions of the latter kind are thus of great interest to experimentalists in the search for new particles and their decays.

Under the consideration of providing as much energy as possible towards the interaction, modern experiments favor colliding beams over fixed-target experiments. By momentum conservation, some of the energy of a fixed-target collision must be converted into the kinetic energies of final state particles, while there is no such constraint for colliding beams. Thus, at high energies, the dependence of the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ on the incoming beam energy $E_{\textrm{beam}}$ in the laboratory frame scales as $\sqrt{s} \propto E_{\textrm{beam}}^{1/2}$ for fixed-targets, whereas it scales linearly for colliding beams $\sqrt{s} \propto E_{\textrm{beam}}$. Because the center-of-mass energy of the collision fixes the energy available for the production of new particles, colliding beams hold the advantage.

Modern experiments also favor circular rather than linear particle accelerators. Because the length of a linear accelerator is correlated with its maximum beam energy, the size required to probe the current energy frontier is prohibitively large, and even then particles can only be accelerated once through the machine. Instead, circular colliders can accelerate particles for multiple orbits until they reach the desired energy scale, and this circulation also allows for the same beams to be collided multiple times to achieve a \textit{luminosity}, a measure of particle flux, that is higher than linear accelerators. The problem faced by circular colliders is synchrotron radiation, where charged particles accelerated along a circular trajectory lose energy. Because a particle's energy loss due to synchrotron radiation is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its mass, electron beams experience incredible energy losses compared to proton beams. For this reason, modern experiments prefer the acceleration and collision of hadron beams.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the culmination of contemporary high energy experiment sensibilities. The world's largest machine, it is a circular accelerator with a circumference of 27 km, spanning across the Franco-Swiss border, and is housed within an underground tunnel at an average depth of 100 m. An illustration is provided in Figure \ref{fig:LHCoverallview}. It features two parallel evacuated beam pipes in which proton beams circulate in opposite directions. Although the design energy of each proton beam is 7 \TeV, the beams are currently circulating at an energy of 6.5 \TeV\ to give a center-of-mass energy of 13 \TeV\ for the one billion proton collisions it produces per second.

    \label{fig:LHCoverallview}
\end{figure}

Because the LHC reuses the tunnels of the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) Collider, additional excavation was avoided and it was integrated as the final stage of CERN's accelerator complex, shown in Figure \ref{fig:CERNcomplex}. The source of protons is a canister of hydrogen gas to which a strong electric field is applied to strip the electrons from the hydrogen nuclei. The protons then pass through the linear accelerator LINAC2 and are accelerated to an energy of 50 \MeV. They are then injected into successive circular accelerators: the Proton Synchrotron Booster which accelerates the beams to 1.4 \GeV, the Proton Synchrotron (PS) which accelerates the beams to 25 GeV, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) which further accelerates the beams to 450 \GeV, and finally the LHC itself. The oscillating radio frequency (RF) fields used to accelerate the protons results in beams composed of proton \textit{bunches} as opposed to a continuous stream. The LHC currently circulates up to 2556 bunches per beam, which is not far from its design value of 2808 bunches per beam.

    \label{fig:CERNcomplex}
\end{figure}

The circular orbit of the proton beams are maintained by the 1,232 bending magnets lining the LHC. The bending magnets are superconducting dipole magnets which generate 8.3 T magnetic fields powerful enough to bend the high energy beams. In order to minimize the oscillation of the bunches around their trajectories and achieve high luminosity, 392 focusing magnets are also placed along the LHC ring. The focusing magnets are superconducting quadrupole magnets with a magnetic field gradient of 223 T/m. They are placed in alternating pairs to account for their nature of focusing along one direction while defocusing the orthogonal direction. Schematics for these two main types of magnets are shown in Figure \ref{fig:lhcmagnets}. In order to maintain the superconductivity of these magnets, the cryogenic systems cool them down to a temperature of 1.9 K.

  \label{fig:lhcmagnets}
\end{figure}

The beams are directed to cross through each other at four sites around the LHC known as interactions points. At these points, fine control of the beam is crucial because it has direct ramifications on the number of possible interactions. The interaction rate of any given process is proportional to its cross section $\sigma$ and the luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ of the collider
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dN}{dt} = \sigma\mathcal{L},
\end{equation}
where $N$ refers to the number of interactions. The cross section, or interaction probability, is fixed by physics while the luminosity is determined by the collider's design, and therefore the highest possible luminosity is desired in order to observe rare interactions such as those that produce Higgs bosons. For equal, bunched beams with a rounded profile, the luminosity can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{ N^{2} k_{b} f \gamma }{ 4 \pi \epsilon_{n} \beta^{\ast} } F,
\end{equation}
where the various parameters are determined by the design of the collider: $N$ is the number of protons per bunch, $k_{b}$ is the number of bunches, $f$ is the revolution frequency, $\gamma$ is the typical Lorentz factor, $\epsilon_{n}$ is the normalized emittance, $\beta^{\ast}$ is the value of the betatron function at the interaction point, and $F$ is the geometrical reduction factor due to the crossing angle.\cite{CMSTDR1}

The LHC has a 25 ns bunch spacing, or time between bunch crossings at the interaction point, which places a constraint on how large $k_{b}$ and $f$ can be. The spacing cannot be lowered due to operational safety concerns, such as providing kicker magnets enough time to ramp up and divert the bunches toward a beam dump for absorption. The normalized emittance $\epsilon_{n}$ is a measure of the kinematic phase space occupied by the particles in the bunch and can be improved by reducing the size of the bunch and the spread in momentum of its particles. The beta function is a measure of the beam's transverse size and so its value at the interaction point $\beta^{\ast}$ is determined by how well the magnets can focus the beam at the interaction point. The geometrical factor $F$ corrects the amount by which the colliding bunches overlap as they are made to cross at a shallow angle. While a head-on collision would result in the greatest overlap, it also increases the chances of long range electromagnetic interactions between bunches, so there is some interplay in determining the crossing angle.

Although the design luminosity of the LHC is $10^{34}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, it has exceeded expectations by achieving a luminosity of twice the designed value. As a measure of particle flux, the luminosity that has been discussed so far is a dynamic quantity and is better called \textit{instantaneous luminosity}. The expected number of interactions $N$ for a specific process is thus given by
\begin{equation}
  N = \sigma \int \mathcal{L}dt = \sigma \mathcal{L}_{int},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ is the \textit{integrated luminosity}, and so the total integrated luminosity is quoted in reference to the size of particle physics datasets.

Surrounding each of the interaction points of the LHC are its four main experiments: A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE), A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS), the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), and the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb). Both ATLAS and CMS are general-purpose detectors designed to search for the Higgs boson and perform precise measurements of its properties, while also exploring the new energy frontier in search of physics beyond the Standard Model. The LHC can also accelerate lead ions, which is used by ALICE to study heavy-ion collisions and the dynamics of quark-gluon plasma. As general-purpose detectors, ATLAS and CMS also study heavy-ion collisions. The LHCb experiment specializes in studying the electroweak and QCD physics of heavy flavor quarks and measuring the properties of B mesons.

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid}

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:CMScutaway}, is a general-purpose particle detector and one of the two main experiments at the LHC. Its cylindrical design is impressively compact for its purpose, with a diameter of 15 m and a length of 28.7 m. Although heavy, weighing in at 14,000 tonnes, the bulk of this weight comes from its steel return yoke and structural supports which together weigh 12,500 tonnes. The return yoke guides and contains the 3.8 T magnetic field generated by the detector's namesake superconducting solenoid, which is cooled by its cryostat to a temperature of 4.5 K during operation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{images/cms_120918_03}
    \caption[Cutaway View of the CMS Detector]{A cutaway view of the CMS detector with its main subsystems and components labeled.\cite{CMScutaway}}
    \label{fig:CMScutaway}
\end{figure}

The solenoid is central to the design of the CMS detector because it provides a uniform magnetic field capable of bending the trajectories of charged particles as they travel through the detector, thereby enabling the measurement of their electric charge and transverse momentum \pT. This follows because a particle with electric charge $q$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ moving through a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ experiences a Lorentz force given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}.
\end{equation}
Since the force is transverse to the direction of motion, the particle travels along a helical path of radius $R$ with a handedness determined by its electric charge. An application of Newton's 2\textsuperscript{nd} Law upon the circular motion of such a particle with mass $m$ and velocity transverse to the direction of motion $v$ further shows that its transverse momentum is determined by the radius of curvature of its path
\begin{equation}
  \frac{mv^{2}}{R} = qvB \implies \pT = qRB,
\end{equation}
where $\pT = mv$ is the transverse momentum of the particle.

While the helical paths of charged particles travelling with low momentum are fully contained within the detector, the trajectories of charged particles with high momentum are recorded as incomplete arcs, either because they decay mid-flight or, in the case of muons, travel out of the detector. While the radius of curvature of such highly energetic particles cannot be directly measured, it can be obtained by measuring the sagitta of their \textit{track}, the arc they trace through the detector.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=4in]{images/sagitta}
    \caption[Sagitta of a Charged Particle Track]{A diagram defining the sagitta of an arc representing a charged particle track (orange) travelling away from the interaction point (IP). The track has a chord of length $L$, an opening angle of $\theta$, a radius of curvature $R$, and a sagitta (red) of length $s$.}
    \label{fig:sagitta}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:sagitta}, a relationship between the chord length $L$, radius of curvature $R$, and sagitta $s$ of the track can be constructed using the Pythagorean Theorem such that
\begin{equation}
  R^{2} = \left( R - s \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{L}{2} \right)^{2}.
\end{equation}
Solving for $R$ with the reasonable assumption that $s \ll L$ yields
\begin{equation}
  R = \frac{L^{2}}{8s} + \frac{s}{2} \approx \frac{L^{2}}{8s},
\end{equation}
and therefore the \pT\ of a charged particle can be determined from the chord length and sagitta of its track
\begin{equation}
  \pT = \frac{qBL^{2}}{8s}.
\end{equation}
The magnetic field strength $B$ and, in part, the chord length $L$ are dictated by the design of the detector, and so the \pT\ resolution is limited by the resolution of the sagitta. As their momentum increases, charged particles leave straighter tracks which make it difficult to accurately measure the sagitta, thereby degrading the resolution at high momentum.

The magnetic field within the solenoid is oriented along the direction of the beam which motivates the coordinate system adopted for the CMS detector that is shown in Figure \ref{fig:CMS_coord_sys}. The geometrical center of the detector defines the origin of the right-handed Cartesian coordinate system with the \textit{z}-axis oriented along the direction of the anticlockwise proton beam from the LHC, the \textit{x}-axis pointing horizontally towards the center of the LHC ring, and the \textit{y}-axis pointing vertically upwards out of the plane of the LHC ring. The shape of the detector also admits a cylindrical description about the same origin. With the \textit{x}-axis and \textit{z}-axis taken to be the polar and longitudinal axes, respectively, a cylindrical coordinate system can be defined with the azimuthal angle $\phi$ taken with respect to the positive \textit{x}-axis ($\phi = 0$) and the polar angle $\theta$ taken with respect to the positive \textit{z}-axis ($\theta = 0$). Because the polar angle $\theta$ is not Lorentz invariant under boosts along the direction of the beam, it is typically transformed into the \textit{pseudorapidity}
\begin{equation}
  \eta = -\ln\left[\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
such that the positive \textit{z}-axis has $\eta = + \infty$ and the positive \textit{y}-axis has $\eta = 0$.

The CMS detector is composed of layers of subsystems dedicated towards the detection and measurement of different types of particles. Hermetic design, but fiducial volume? coverage? high pseudorapidity or very \textit{forward} particles lost down the beam pipe or lack of coverage, radiation

%Another problem in LaTeX is the inability to handle long tables. While there are some packages that address this problem none of them quite fit the Editorial Office guidelines. The caption is not repeated but we do need "Table x-y. Continued" on each subsequent page and a repeat of the column headings on each page as well. The following table is the best example of the correct format I can produce. The disadvantage of this method is that much of it is manually set up and changes in the text will cause changes in the table. \citep{Moffatt69} For best results avoid the use of footnotemark and footnotetext commands inside of tables and try to keep your footnotes outside of floats whenever possible.
