\chapter{ANALYSIS STRATEGY} \label{strategy}

The first \VHbb\ analysis conducted by the CMS collaboration in 2012\cite{HIG13012} demonstrated that an observation of the \Hbb\ decay was feasible by combining searches for the \ZnnHbb, \WenHbb, \WmnHbb, \ZeeHbb, and \ZmmHbb\ decay channels. The overall strategy that it pioneered has remained largely intact, even through the transition to LHC Run 2. The search for \VHbb\ using the 2016 dataset would establish evidence for the \Hbb\ decay in 2017\cite{CMSVHbbEvidence} with only incremental improvements. The search for \VHbb\ using the 2017 dataset would build on the physics insights and experiences obtained the year prior while bringing to bear additional event reconstruction techniques and deep learning to finally observe the \Hbb\ decay in 2018.\cite{HIG18016} This chapter describes the analysis strategy used by CMS to achieve its state of the art result, with a focus on the \ZnnHbb\ decay channel in particular.\footnote{This chapter includes content adapted from Ref. \cite{CMSVHbbEvidence} and \cite{HIG18016}, as the author's work directly contributed to those publications.}

\section{Data and Simulation}

\subsection{Data}

The datasets used for this analysis were collected by the CMS detector throughout 2017 and produced by proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13\ \TeV$ and a bunch spacing of 25 ns. The \ZnnH\ channel uses the MET dataset, the \WenH\ channel uses the SingleElectron dataset, the \WmnH\ channel uses the SingleMuon dataset, the \ZeeH\ channel uses the DoubleEG dataset, and the \ZmmH\ channel uses the DoubleMuon dataset. All of these primary datasets have an approximate total luminosity of 41.3 \invfb\ when only considering \textit{golden} events, which were certified by data quality monitoring teams to have been collected during periods of normal function for all detector subsystems. The JSON certification file \texttt{Cert\_294927-306462\_13TeV\_EOY2017ReReco\_Collisions17\_JSON\_v1.txt} was used to filter for golden events.

\subsection{Simulation}

Simulated samples for each of the relevant signal and background processes are used to design and validate the analysis strategy in an unbiased manner. These samples are produced using different Monte-Carlo (MC) generators and processed by the \textsc{\small GEANT4}\cite{GEANT4A,GEANT4B,GEANT4C} software which realistically models the detector's response to the passage of particles through its materials. The reconstruction of these MC events was performed using CMS SoftWare (CMSSW) version 94X releases set to match the 2017 data taking conditions.

The signal samples, generated using the \textsc{\small POWHEG} v2\cite{POWHEGA,POWHEGB,POWHEGC} event generator, are listed in Table \ref{tbl:MCsignal}. The quark-induced signal processes are generated to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in QCD using the MiNLO procedure \cite{MINLOA,MINLOB}, while the gluon-induced contributions to the $ZH$ signal processes are generated only to leading order (LO) accuracy in QCD. Their production cross sections and branching fractions are taken to be the state of the art values calculated for a Higgs boson mass of $\massH = 125\ \GeV$ from Ref. \cite{CERNYR4}, and specifically those listed in sections \ref{productionmodes} and \ref{decaymodes}. These production cross sections are further rescaled to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD and NLO electroweak accuracy as a function of the transverse momentum of the vector boson \pTV, according to the combined calculations of the \textsc{\small VHNNLO}\cite{VHNNLOA,VHNNLOB,VHNNLOC,VHNNLOD}, \textsc{\small VH@NNLO}\cite{VHATNNLOA,VHATNNLOB}, and \textsc{\small HAWK} v2.0\cite{HAWK} event generators as described in Ref. \cite{CERNYR4}.

The diboson samples listed in Table \ref{tbl:MCdiboson} are generated using the \textsc{\small MadGraph5\_amc@NLO} v2.4.2\cite{AMCNLO} event generator at NLO accuracy with the FxFx\cite{FXFX} merging scheme and up to two additional partons. The exception is the inclusive \bosZ\bosZ\ sample which is only simulated to LO accuracy and generated using \textsc{\small PYTHIA} v8.230\cite{PYTHIA8} event generator. Although the cross section of the \texttt{ZZTo2L2Q} sample has been obtained from an NLO calculation, the other cross sections are taken to be the product of their measured inclusive cross sections\cite{WWxsec,WZxsec,ZZxsec} and the appropriate branching ratio as computed by the Particle Data Group (PDG) in Ref. \cite{PDG2018}.

The \bosV+jets samples are also produced using the \textsc{\small MadGraph5\_amc@NLO} v2.4.2 event generator but at LO accuracy with the MLM matching scheme\cite{MLM}. Besides their inclusive and HT-binned configurations, \qrkb-quark enriched versions with up to four additional partons are also generated to increase the statistical power of these samples in the phase space most relevant for signal events because the \bosV+jets processes are the primary irreducible backgrounds. The samples for \bosW+jets with $\bosW \rightarrow \ell\nu$ are listed in Table \ref{tbl:MCWtoLNu}, while the samples for \bosZ+jets with $\bosZ \rightarrow \ell\bar{\ell}$ are listed in Table \ref{tbl:MCZtoLL} and with $\bosZ \rightarrow \nu\bar{\nu}$ are listed in Table \ref{tbl:MCZtoNuNu}. The cross sections of the \bosV+jets samples are multiplied by \textit{k}-factors of 1.21 and 1.23 for the \bosW+jets and \bosZ+jets samples, respectively, which rescale them to their NNLO cross sections as calculated by the \textsc{\small FEWZ} 3.1\cite{FEWZA,FEWZB,FEWZC} software. The cross sections of the \qrkb-quark enriched samples are further multiplied by a stitching factor which allows them to be used in conjunction with the inclusive and HT-binned versions by appropriately scaling their cross sections.

The set of parton distribution functions, which define the distribution of a hadron's momentum among its partons, used to generate all of the Monte-Carlo samples was chosen to be the NNPDF3.1\cite{NNPDF} set. The parton showering and hadronization was handled by interfacing the matrix element generators with \textsc{\small PYTHIA} v8.230. Finally, additional $pp$ interactions are added to the hard-scattering process to simulate pileup, with a multiplicity distribution matched to the 2017 data taking conditions.

\subsection{Triggers}

Each channel employs a subset of the available triggers to select data events which are consistent with their signal hypothesis. The \ZnnH\ channel uses triggers which place thresholds on the missing tranverse energy (MET), missing transverse hadronic energy (MHT), and tranverse hadronic energy (HT) in an event. The \WenH\ and \WmnH\ channels both use single lepton triggers, while the \ZeeH\ and \ZmmH\ channels both use di-lepton triggers, which place thresholds on the transverse momentum of isolated leptons. The specific triggers used by each channel are detailed in Table \ref{tbl:triggers2017}. Because the triggers are also emulated during simulation, the MC events are also required to satisfy the same triggers as used in data.

The primary trigger for the \ZnnH\ channel is \texttt{HLT\_PFMET120\_PFMHT120\_IDTight}, which requires both particle-flow (PF) MET and MHT to be above 120 \GeV. The corresponding triggers at L1 are seeded by ETM with thresholds ranging from 100 \GeV\ to 120 \GeV\, which varies based on the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC in order to maintain reasonable trigger rates. The online PF MET, though similar to the offline version, uses a simplified version of tracking and is evaluted as the transverse momentum (\pT) imbalance of all PF objects reconstructed at the HLT which includes photons, electrons, muons, and corrected jets from neutral and charged hadrons. The online PF MHT considers corrected PF jets with $\pT > 20 \GeV$ and $\left|\eta\right| < 5.2$ which have neutral hadronic fraction $< 0.9$, neutral electromagnetic fraction $< 0.99$, and at least one constituent. The jets contributing to the PF MHT which lie within the tracker acceptance, or $\left|\eta\right| < 2.4$, are also required to have charged hadronic fraction $> 0$, charged electromagnetic fraction $< 0.99$, and charged multiplicity $> 0$.

The secondary trigger for the \ZnnH\ channel, \texttt{\small HLT\_PFMET120\_PFMHT120\_IDTight\_PFHT60}, additionally requires the PF HT to be above 60 \GeV. This additional requirement was verified to pose no significant impact, as there are at least two highly-energetic jets present in the events considered by the analysis. Because the primary trigger was sometimes inactive during run period F, this secondary trigger is used to guarantee full coverage throughout 2017 by taking the logical \texttt{OR} of the two triggers.

The trigger efficiency of the logical \texttt{OR} of the primary and secondary MET triggers is measured using the SingleElectron primary dataset. Because the single-electron triggers are orthogonal to the MET triggers, this dataset provides an unbiased sample with which the trigger efficiency can be measured. In addition to passing the \texttt{OR} of the primary and secondary MET triggers, events are also required to have two jets within the tracker acceptance and the electron is required to have $\left|\Delta\phi(\lepe, \textrm{MET})\right| < 2.5$. This separation in azimuthal angle rejects events which have electrons that are back-to-back with the reconstructed MET in order to avoid bias from the L1 MET. As the triggers are parameterized by both the online PF MET and PF MHT, the efficiency is measured as a function of the minimum of the offline MET and MHT, i.e. $\min(\textrm{MET}, \textrm{MHT})$.
